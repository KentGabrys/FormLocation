# Form Location Recorder
Record window size, location, and screen per form component

Allows you to track the size and location of all forms in your application, 
requires two lines of code in each form you wish to track. Saves your form's 
location and size in a JSON settings form by form name.

The next time you open the form it appears in the location to which you last
closed it and sized to the size that it last appeared.
